        <h4>The inception of Internet has dramatically revolutionized many fields. Internet has 
            made life of people so easy that people today have access to any information they 
            want sitting at their home. One of the main fields that Internet has revolutionized is 
            communication. And talking about communication over Internet, the first thing that 
            comes in our mind is E-mail. E-mails are considered to be the most reliable way of 
            communication over Internet, for sending or receiving some important information. 
            But there is a special criterion for humans to access the Internet and the criteria is you 
            must be able to see. You must be thinking that what sort of criteria is this, everyone 
            with eyes can see. But there are also especially abled people in our society who are 
            not gifted with what you have. Yes, there are some visually challenged people or blind 
            people who cannot see things and thus cannot see the computer screen or keyboard. 
            A survey shows that there are more than 250 million visually challenged people 
            around the globe. That is, around 250 million people are unaware of how to use 
            Internet or E-mail.
            So, that we created this project for blind people to communication with other persons 
            through emails by using voice commands and we totally eliminate mouse and key 
            board operations. It is a user-friendly and from this we can only send mail to other 
            persons.</h4>>

        <h4>This e-mail system can be used by any user of any age group with ease of access. It has 
            highlight of speech to content just as content to speech with discourse reader which 
            makes planned framework to be taken care of by outwardly hindered individual too. 
            Now the visually impaired people can send and receive mails with a lot of ease only 
            through voice commands without making any use of a keyboard or any mouse. It has 
            helped eradicate the difficulties that the blind people face and made them more the 
            normal individuals. It has wiped out the idea of utilizing console easy routes alongside 
            screen readers which will help decreasing the intellectual heap of recollecting console 
            alternate ways. Also any non-sophisticated user who does not know the position of keys 
            on the keyboard need not bother as keyboard usage is eliminated. Instructions given by 
            the IVR accordingly to get the respective services offered.
